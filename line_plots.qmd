### Import libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

### Read in files, use a for loop to assign csv files to their named dataframes

```{r}
## Loop through each file in directory, load it as the first 3 letters of the file - "gly.csv" would load as gly

#setwd("csv_files") - uncomment when to set wd

#read in all csv files in csv_files folder
list <- lapply(Sys.glob("*.csv"), read.csv)

#create a vector that we'll use to name the dataframe for each amino acid
amino_acids <- list("ala", "arg", "asn", "asp", "gln", "glu", "gly", "his", "ile", "leu", "lys", "phe", "pro", "ser", "thr", "trp", "tyr", "val")


#loop through each csv in list, store as its corresponding amino acid in a dataframe
for(i in list) {
  for(j in amino_acids) {
    amino_acids[j] <- as.data.frame(list[i])
    break
    }
}


```

### Clean data - remove unused columns

### Clean data 2 - remove shallow rock and other unused rows

### Clean data 3 - split into 4 different data frames

### Clean data 4 - rename columns
